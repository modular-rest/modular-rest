# Modular-REST Documentation

## 1. Introduction
- What is Modular-REST?
- Key Features
- Architecture Overview

*Introduces Modular-REST, its core philosophy of simplifying backend development, and its function-based approach to API creation.*

## 2. Getting Started
Provides a rapid introduction to Modular-REST, from installation to creating a basic application, focusing on its unique approach to backend development.*

1. Installation (Server and Client): 
   This subsection covers the basic setup process for both the server and client components of Modular-REST. It includes system requirements, installation commands, and initial configuration steps.

2. Quick Start Guide: 
   This is a condensed overview designed to get users up and running with a minimal Modular-REST setup as quickly as possible. It should cover:
   - Basic server setup
   - Defining a simple function (e.g., "Hello World")
   - Connecting with the client
   - Making a function call
   The goal is to demonstrate the core concept of Modular-REST's function-based approach in just a few minutes, without delving into details.

3. Building Your First Modular-REST Application: 
   This is a more comprehensive, step-by-step tutorial that guides users through building a small but functional application. It should include:
   - Setting up a Modular-REST server with multiple functions
   - Implementing basic CRUD operations using Modular-REST's approach
   - Integrating with a database
   - Handling authentication
   - Using the client library to interact with the server
   This section provides a practical, hands-on experience that showcases Modular-REST's capabilities in a real-world scenario.
